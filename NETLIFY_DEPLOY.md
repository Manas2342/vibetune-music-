# 🚀 VibeTune - Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Netlify

Your project is ready to deploy! Here are the easiest methods:

---

## 🌐 Method 1: Netlify Web UI (Easiest - No CLI!)

### **Step 1: Go to Netlify**
1. Open your browser and go to: **[app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)**
2. **Sign up or Login** with:
   - GitHub (recommended)
   - GitLab
   - Bitbucket
   - Or Email

### **Step 2: Deploy Your Project**

#### **Option A: Drag & Drop (Fastest!)**
1. Build your project first:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/manasranjanseth/Desktop/MANAS\ CODING/Manas\ vibetune\ project/vibetune4/vibetune4
   npm run build
   ```

2. On Netlify, click **"Add new site"** → **"Deploy manually"**

3. **Drag and drop** the `dist/spa` folder from:
   ```
   /Users/manasranjanseth/Desktop/MANAS CODING/Manas vibetune project/vibetune4/vibetune4/dist/spa
   ```

4. Wait for deployment (1-2 minutes) ✅

#### **Option B: Import from Git (Automated)**
1. First, push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "VibeTune music app"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vibetune.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. On Netlify, click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**

3. Choose **GitHub** and authorize Netlify

4. Select your **vibetune** repository

5. Netlify will auto-detect settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build:client`
   - Publish directory: `dist/spa`

6. Click **"Deploy site"**

---

## 🔧 Method 2: Netlify CLI (Advanced)

### **Step 1: Install Netlify CLI**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### **Step 2: Login to Netlify**
```bash
netlify login
```

### **Step 3: Deploy**
```bash
cd /Users/manasranjanseth/Desktop/MANAS\ CODING/Manas\ vibetune\ project/vibetune4/vibetune4
netlify init
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## 📝 CRITICAL: After Deployment

Once deployed, you MUST add environment variables:

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variables**

1. **Go to**: Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site Settings → Environment Variables

2. **Click**: "Add a variable" and add these **4 variables**:

```
Variable Name: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
Value: c988ff755c9d4e2594da9e1440a890ea

Variable Name: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
Value: 4b3328d89b494cebaa60ad77af98dd30

Variable Name: SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI
Value: https://your-site-name.netlify.app/callback

Variable Name: NODE_ENV
Value: production
```

**Important**: Replace `your-site-name` with your actual Netlify URL!

3. **Click**: "Save" and then **"Trigger deploy"** to rebuild

### **Step 2: Update Spotify App Settings**

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your app (Client ID: c988ff755c9d4e2594da9e1440a890ea)
3. Click **"Edit Settings"**
4. Add your Netlify URL to **"Redirect URIs"**:
   ```
